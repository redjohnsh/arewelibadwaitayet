# Are We LibAdwaita Yet?

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
|   └── apps.ts
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## Contributing

If you spot an app that is not yet listed on the page you can just fork the repo and add it to the `src/apps.ts` file. Each app has four fields which are required. The app **must** be published on [flathub](https://flathub.org) for it to work.
